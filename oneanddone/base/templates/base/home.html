      One and Done gives users a wide variety of ways to contribute to Mozilla. You can pick an easy task that only takes a few minutes&#45; or take on a bigger challenge. This includes working on manual testing, automation, bug verification, mobile testing and more. Tasks are from all QA teams&#45; so you can get involved with Automation, Firefox OS, Desktop Firefox, Mozilla websites, Services, or Thunderbird.

            Mozilla QA sees the "One and Done" initiative as a way for Mozilla community contributors to get introduced to various projects and then to become involved in an area of their interest. Contributors would be able to find their voice in the community, be able to engage meaningfully, and feel rewarded for their contribution.
